# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue that poses significant challenges for financial institutions and consumers worldwide. The sophistication of fraudulent activities has made it increasingly difficult to detect and prevent credit card fraud in real-time. To address this problem, this research project aims to leverage exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to develop effective and efficient fraud detection models. By identifying the patterns and triggers of fraudulent activities related to credit card usage, these models can enable faster detection, prevention, and response times, ultimately reducing financial losses and enhancing customer trust and loyalty. 

The data set for this research project will be obtained from Kaggle, a popular data science platform. The chosen data set comprises 284,807 credit card transactions, with 492 of them being fraudulent. The data set contains transaction data and other relevant features that can be used to identify patterns and triggers related to fraudulent activities.
